# Project-5
To effectively use the different pages in Power BI to view data about Customers, Order Details, and Products, follow these guidelines:

Page 1 - Basic Summary:
This page serves as an overview of the entire project. It can include key performance indicators (KPIs) and high-level insights. Users should expect to find a summary of customer data, order details, and product information. You can use visualizations like pie charts or bar graphs to highlight key metrics, such as total revenue, average order quantity, and product category distribution.

Page 2 - Product Monitoring:
This page focuses on product-related data. Users can explore product names, categories, and units in stock. It may include visuals like tables, bar charts, and slicers to filter and analyze product information. Users can track product inventory, identify popular categories, and analyze stock levels over time.

Page 3 - Customer Monitoring:
Page 3 is dedicated to customer-related data, including customer titles, names, addresses, and phone numbers. Users can leverage visuals like tables, customer profiles, or geographical maps to gain insights into customer demographics, distribution, and contact details. You can also use filters to segment customers based on different attributes.

Page 4 - Orders Monitoring:
This page provides a comprehensive view of order details, including order dates, quantities, and discounts. Users can analyze order trends, identify peak order periods, and assess the impact of discounts on sales. Visualizations like line charts, bar graphs, and tables are useful for this page.

In summary, each page in your Power BI project serves a specific purpose. Page 1 gives an overview, Page 2 focuses on products, Page 3 on customers, and Page 4 on orders. Users can navigate between these pages to access detailed information about the data elements you've mentioned and gain valuable insights into your business operations.
